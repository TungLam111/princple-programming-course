"""
When using deep copy, that means we create new list object with reference to the copies of child objects in original list object
1. True. "==" operation means you compare value with each other. values of v1 and v2 are equal
2. False. v1 and v2 refer to totally different objects so the object id of them cannot be equal
3. True. v1[0] and v2[0] are immutable
4. True. This statement just compares values with each other so they are equal
5. False. v1[3] and v2[3] are two objects, unlike the case in Exercise 6, so they do not have the same id
